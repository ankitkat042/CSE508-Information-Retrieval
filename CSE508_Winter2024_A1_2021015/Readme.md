- Methodologies: 
    - used `os` and then extracted the file list and then preprocessed in the same sequence mentioned in the question

- Assumptions: NA

Original Text: Works great as a guitar bench mat. Not rugged enough for abuse but if you take care of it, it will take care of you. Makes organization of workspace much easier because screws won't roll around. Color is good too.

Original Text: We use these for everything from our acoustic bass down to our ukuleles. I know there is a smaller model available for ukes, violins, etc.; we haven't yet ordered those, but these will work on smaller instruments if one doesn't extend the feet to their maximum width. They're gentle on the instruments, and the grippy material keeps them secure.

The greatest benefit has been when writing music at the computer and needing to set a guitar down to use the keyboard/mouse - just easier for me than a hanging stand.

We have several and gave one to a friend for Christmas as well. I've used mine on stage, and it folds up small enough to fit right in my gig bag.

Original Text: I bought this bass to split time as my primary bass with my Dean Edge. This might be winning me over. The bass boost is outstanding. The active pickups really allow you to adjust to the sound you want. I recommend this for anyone. If you're a beginner  like I was not too long ago, it's an excellent bass to start with. If you're on tour and/or music is making you money, this bass will be beatiful on stage. The color is a bit darker than in the picture. But, all around, this is a great buy.

### Question 2: Unigram Inverted Index and Boolean Queries

- In-Between Step- Preprocessing complete dataset after 5 files. Each file is lowercased, tokenized, removed stop words like `this`, `that` etc, then punctuations are removed and after everything, blank spaces are removed. 

- Approach:
    - created a dictionary datastructure using nested for loop where words are keys and values are all the documents they are in.
    - in a for loop queries are solved and stored in a temparory set resolving from left to right without considering traditional priorities.

- Methodologies: 
    - brute force method by iterating through each doc

- Assumptions: words are already processed

- Results: A pickle file is saved which is a serialized version of the inverted_index dictionary.

### Question 3: Positional Index and Phrase Queries
References:
- https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/positional-indexes-1.html
- https://www.linkedin.com/advice/3/how-do-you-optimize-phrase-queries-using

- Approach:
    - The function initializes an empty set named `docs`. For the first word in the query, it retrieves the set of document identifiers (docIDs) where this word appears from the positional index and stores them in `docs`. This set represents the potential documents that could contain the phrase.
    - Then iterates over each word in the phrase query starting from the second word. For each word, it performs the following steps:
        - It intersects the current set of candidate documents (docs) with the set of documents containing the current word. This is done to narrow down the list of documents to those that contain all words seen so far.
        - For each document in this intersection, it checks if the current word follows the previous word in the sequence. This is determined by checking if any position of the previous word (`p`) plus one is a position listed for the current word in the same document. This step ensures that the words are not just present in the document but also follow each other in the correct order.

- Methodologies: 
    - A temporary set `temp_docs` is used to collect documents where the current word follows the previous word in sequence.
    - For each document in the narrowed down set, it retrieves the positions of the previous word and checks if adding one to any of these positions matches any position of the current word in the same document. If this condition is met, it means the current word directly follows the previous word in this document, so the document is added to `temp_docs`.
    - After checking all documents, docs is updated to be `temp_docs`, effectively filtering down the set of documents to those that maintain the word order up to the current word in the iteration.

- Assumptions: The query will be searched for exact match and if any word(s) appear in between the original text, that result in different adjacent position but same relative position, the search query will be treated as unsuccessfull

- Results:

```
