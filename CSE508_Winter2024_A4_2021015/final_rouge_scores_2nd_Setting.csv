I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips.  In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip.  This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind.<br /><br />I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco.  I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area.  Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any.  I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Amazon in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me.<br /><br />They are definitely worth the money.  I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips.  The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips.  I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do.  Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them.<br /><br />As for the portion size, it's pretty generous.  For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors.

The bag is made out of a sort of nylon-type mesh instead of paper, so you don't get any weird paper taste (it matters more in the more delicate herbal teas than the darker black teas, for me anyway). Secondly, inside the tea bag, you get actual mint leaves, not tiny flakes and dust. And because the tea bag has a more 3-dimensional shape, the leaves don't get crushed as much either. The flavor is absolutely delightful! It's very smooth and aromatic, no bitterness or anything unpleasant at all. Great night time tea or anytime relaxing tea! If you don't like your tea very strong, you can use one tea bag to infuse two cups. Also, if you're not that into hot tea, this tastes pretty good cold as well, especially if you add a little sugar.

How would ""I"" rate the item?  Do ""I"" like it?  Uh, sure, I feel really emotional about this item and I absolutely love it, can't you just picture me sitting here chewing on one of these treat biscuits?<br /><br />I suppose I shouldn't joke too much here since there's been stories of some people eating dog food for years, but really, I'm the human in the animal+human equation here and my opinion really isn't the one that matters for this product.  What matters is what the doggie thinks, or how she seems to react to being given one of these treats.  It's here that things remain tough though as the family dog behaves like many dogs do -- if it's at all edible, and heck, for a lot of things that aren't (like her stuffed toys that all die quick deaths), she'll have it gone so quickly you question whether she ever even tasted whatever it was you gave her.<br /><br />With that said, these dry biscuits do tend to slow her down a little, at least compared to some of the other treats we might give her.  (For example: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OUOYH6"">Cardinal Laboratories Pet Botanics Training Rewards Treats, Beef 20 Ounces</a>).  Being dry, she's got to slow down a bit and crunch up these treats.  In our case, with a smaller dog (Pomeranian), she really has to crunch things up, even if we break these biscuits apart (they come as breakable bars with two smaller portions in each bar).  A larger dog wouldn't have that much work to do, or at least I doubt they would.  I'll find out a bit later as I intend to take a few of these treats over to my lady friend's house where her much bigger family dog can give them a try.<br /><br />Realistically, the Newman's Own brand is one that I enjoy supporting.  They have a good reputation for me and their products are always good.

When it was done, the color was fairly light, so I only added a small amount of milk.  Still, the flavor was a bit too bland for me, and I like a mild coffee.

I enjoy Rooibos on occasion and use it for chai when serving to people who are sensative to caffine.<br /><br />One important point about Rooibos is that it isn't technically tea it doesn't come from the Camellia Sinensis fmaily and therefore is considered an herbal.  It's a common mistake to label things which aren't true tea as teas, but a bigger mistake would be to label this ""espresso"".<br /><br />The only thing Red Espresso has in common with Espresso (aside from how you may chose to prepare it) is how it is ground.  When dealing with herbals and teas the more surface area that the water has contact with when you brew it, the more bitter the resulting beverage. With Red Espresso, rather than getting a sweet and clean tasting beverage, that you'd get from traditionally prepared rooibos, you get one which is much more bitter and sharp.<br /><br />I tried preparing this tea a number of different ways and found it took a lot to get the water to grounds ratio right. With only one exception I was never quite pleased with the resulting beverage.  The best luck I had with Red Espresso was to put it on the stovetop in water and then add chai spices to the mix, drain through a strainer and then adding milk and sweetner.<br /><br />I recognize people will turn to products like this for the health benefits, but I think they'll be disappointed with the experience of drinking this like coffee. For a much better coffee substitute I recommend Choffy which approximates the taste of coffee much closer.<br /><br />But if you're looking to give up your regular cup-o-joe for tea, this isn't the way to go. You'd be much better served picking up some Yunnan Gold or an Assam black tea, brewing it strong and adding milk and sweetener (if desired). If you're set on rooibos then look for the full unground needles to use to brew a much more pleasant cup.",good espresso substitute ok rooibos chai,avid tea drinker turned drink realizing body ca nt really tolerate coffee enjoy rooibos occasion use chai serving people sensative caffineone important point rooibos nt technically tea nt come camellia sinensis fmaily therefore considered herbal s common mistake label things nt true tea teas bigger mistake would label espresso the thing red espresso common espresso aside may chose prepare ground dealing herbals teas surface area water contact brew bitter resulting beverage red espresso rather getting sweet clean tasting beverage d get traditionally prepared rooibos get one much bitter sharpi tried preparing tea number different ways found took lot get water grounds ratio right one exception never quite pleased resulting beverage best luck red espresso put stovetop water add chai spices mix drain strainer adding milk sweetneri recognize people turn products like health benefits think ll disappointed experience drinking like coffee much better coffee substitute recommend choffy approximates taste coffee much closerbut re looking give regular cupojoe tea nt way go d much better served picking yunnan gold assam black tea brewing strong adding milk sweetener desired re set rooibos look full unground needles use brew much pleasant cup,0.02127659574468085,0.6666666666666666,0.041237113402061855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015957446808510637,0.5,0.03092783505154639

I took a shot at Community Coffee's whole-bean French Roast.  I bought a Hamilton Beach coffee bean grinder, so I refuse to buy pre-ground coffee.  Psychologically, doing so would negate the value that the coffee-bean grinder would provide to me.<br /><br />With that aside, 2 of the 3 bags of coffee that came in the package were shrink-wrapped, meaning that you could see the shapes of the coffee beans through the package since it was vacuum sealed.  The other package was loose, like you'd see at your typical grocery store. I'm pretty sure it didn't effect the quality of the brew, but it's just something that I noticed.<br /><br />Moving on to the bottom line here: the coffee tastes good, but might be too strong for some.  I'm used to good 'ole McDonald's coffee, which to me, is decent.  I like Peet's and various Sumatra blends from Coffee Bean and Starbucks, but herein lies the issue with choosing coffee: how do you know how strong a particular coffee is going to be?  A solid solution would be to rate the coffee on a scale of 1-10, 1 being weak and 10 being super-strong.  In using this guideline, I'd rate this coffee a 10 in terms of strength.  It's great early in the morning when you need a quick jolt of caffeine, but not-so-good in the afternoon or evening.<br /><br />Anyhow, this was worth a shot...I plan on ordering more Community Coffee, just a weaker blend.",excellent quality may bit strong,hundreds thousands coffee brands andor types s tough choose one especially online without tasting took shot community coffee s wholebean french roast bought hamilton beach coffee bean grinder refuse buy preground coffee psychologically would negate value coffeebean grinder would provide mewith aside 2 3 bags coffee came package shrinkwrapped meaning could see shapes coffee beans package since vacuum sealed package loose like d see typical grocery store m pretty sure nt effect quality brew s something noticedmoving bottom line coffee tastes good might strong m used good ole mcdonald s coffee decent like peet s various sumatra blends coffee bean starbucks herein lies issue choosing coffee know strong particular coffee going solid solution would rate coffee scale 110 1 weak 10 superstrong using guideline d rate coffee 10 terms strength s great early morning need quick jolt caffeine notsogood afternoon eveninganyhow worth shot plan ordering community coffee weaker blend,0.013245033112582781,0.4,0.02564102564102564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013245033112582781,0.4,0.02564102564102564

I have found that almost anything I used with milk, I can use this instead. The only time I prefer milk is in my coffee, and even then I use ""Lactaid"", which is a lactose free milk. Coffee-wise, I just like the creamier consistency better and also the soy milk seems to break up in hot coffee.<br /><br />I use Soymilk in my cereal, both hot and cold, and it's a wonderful replacement for milk or ice cream when used in a smoothie, with some ice and fruit(or any flavor you want to add.) Works great as a glass of soy with any meal.A refreshing taste, that, after a while you may even think is better than milk. The Vanilla, which is naturally flavored, gives just a hint of flavor to make it a little different then the plain for a little variety. But the Plain is good too.<br /><br />It's a a great source of Protein, with 9 grm. per 8 oz. serving,and 46 mg isoflavones, it also supplies 4% calcium and 10% iron in each serving. Ingredients are Organic Soymilk(filtered water, whole Organic Soybeans),Natural Vanilla Flavor With Other Natural Flavors. Per serving it supplies 100 calories, 4.5g Fat, 0.5saturated fat, 0 g of trans, 2.5 polyunsat fat,1g monosat fat. NO cholesterol(this is always a big plus for me),30mg sodium 300 mg potassium, 4 gr dietary fiber and 1g sugars (not added but coming from the ingredients). The only thing it lacks is the Vit D that is added to milk, so you may have to check around and find another source for that of something you like.<br /><br />Packaged in a slim 32 0z. box, with an easy pour recloseable spout, it has a long shelf life, and should be refrigerated once it's open, at which point it is usually good for about a week to 10 days. The price is about the same, give a take a few cents, as it is at my neighborhood grocery store...BUT-The shipping is so high, this is one product I would not recommend to buy on line.

280809,B0017I1QAW,A1RT5A6U67HGYA,bipolypesca,6,6,5,1311724800,Perfect.,"Boy, does it make me sad to see so many people leaving comments about shipping problems as ""reviews,"" rating the product down because of the service received.  This salsa has only a 4 star average rating, strictly because of people who don't understand what a product review is, and it's unfair both to the manufacturer of the product (in this case a relatively small, family-owned operation in Texas called Riba Foods), nor shoppers who are trying to find a good product based on this review system.  How I wish Amazon would offer a ""this is not a review"" button as opposed to just ""helpful,"" ""not helpful,"" and ""abuse.""  (We can all click ""not helpful,"" but that doesn't counter the inaccurate product rating; and it's not ""abuse,"" just ignorance.)<br /><br />Here--before I get rightfully accused of hypocrisy--is my REVIEW of this SALSA: It's fantastic.  There are very, very few salsas sold in run-of-the-mill grocery stores marketed as ""hot"" that are actually HOT.  I have had ""hot"" salsas that list no type of hot chilies in the ingredients, and show it.  I have had ""hot"" salsas that were as tepid as canned tomatoes.  I have had ""hot"" salsas that, while tasty, just barely break the medium barrier.  This is not one of those.  It is actually spicy, how-about-some-milk, oh-dear-is-that-stomach-acid-in-my-throat-lining, this-can't-be-good-for-my-ulcer HOT!  I love it!<br /><br />An aside: The only other relatively widely available hot salsa that I can think of is Mrs. Renfro's Mango Habanero.  I love that one, too, but it suffers from the unfortunate problem of being too thin.  Watery thin.  With very few chunks.  The taste is fantastic, but the texture is monumentally disappointing.<br /><br />Well, not so with this one: The texture is perfect--it's thick and it clings to the chip.  You can see all the little flecks of roasted chili skin in there, and all the seeds, too.<br /><br />The one thing that threw me about this salsa--and made me bypass it several times before finally trying it--is that the ingredients list contains carrots.  ...CARROTS?  That's just weird.<br /><br />What's even weirder is that there is no hint of them in the salsa.  No carrot flavour, no carrot texture, and I can't find a chunk of carrot in that jar to save my life.  I suspect they might be pureed for thickening--maybe that's what makes the salsa thicker and more clingy than you usually get with a traditional Mexican roasted salsa like this one.<br /><br />You can taste the roasted pepper flavour, you can really feel the heat, the tomatoes are stellar, and it's not too salty (the tortilla chip provides enough of that!).  The burn lasts, too.  I find myself sucking air over my tongue for several minutes after I've stopped indulging.<br /><br />If you like truly spicy salsa without having to track down a specialty chilihead shoppe, and you know the deliciousness of roasted peppers (heck, roasted anything!), then give it a try.  I can't imagine you would regret it.<br /><br />Oh, and when you do try it and find you love it: Do everyone a favour and leave a review on the product about the PRODUCT.  If you think it's a five star salsa with 2 star shipping... the proper rating is FIVE STARS.  Not four, not three, but five.  Save your shipping complaints for the SHIPPER.  It's only fair.",perfect,boy make sad see many people leaving comments shipping problems reviews rating product service received salsa 4 star average rating strictly people nt understand product review s unfair manufacturer product case relatively small familyowned operation texas called riba foods shoppers trying find good product based review system wish amazon would offer review button opposed helpful helpful abuse click helpful nt counter inaccurate product rating s abuse ignorance get rightfully accused hypocrisy review salsa s fantastic salsas sold runofthemill grocery stores marketed hot actually hot hot salsas list type hot chilies ingredients show hot salsas tepid canned tomatoes hot salsas tasty barely break medium barrier one actually spicy howaboutsomemilk ohdearisthatstomachacidinmythroatlining thiscantbegoodformyulcer hot love aside relatively widely available hot salsa think mrs renfro s mango habanero love one suffers unfortunate problem thin watery thin chunks taste fantastic texture monumentally disappointingwell one texture perfect s thick clings chip see little flecks roasted chili skin seeds toothe one thing threw salsa made bypass several times finally trying ingredients list contains carrots carrots s weirdwhat s even weirder hint salsa carrot flavour carrot texture ca nt find chunk carrot jar save life suspect might pureed thickening maybe s makes salsa thicker clingy usually get traditional mexican roasted salsa like oneyou taste roasted pepper flavour really feel heat tomatoes stellar s salty tortilla chip provides enough burn lasts find sucking air tongue several minutes ve stopped indulgingif like truly spicy salsa without track specialty chilihead shoppe know deliciousness roasted peppers heck roasted anything give try ca nt imagine would regret itoh try find love everyone favour leave review product product think s five star salsa 2 star shipping proper rating five stars four three five save shipping complaints shipper s fair,,,,,,,,,

Surprisingly she took to the taste of the Wellness Small Breed Weight Control kibble almost immediately. I didn't even need to ween her off of the Wellness original kibble, just gave her the weight control formula and she liked it, no problems with her digestion. The color of the kibble is slightly less brown than the original adult formula, but she did not seem to notice a difference at all. She likes the small size of the kibble, and recently I have noticed that she has lost about 4 ounces... not much but it is a start. Hopefully with exercise and some restraint by me, she will be within her normal weight range, but I am happy I made the switch and will continue to purchase this brand.<br />TIP: My dog is a picky eater, so I sometimes mix a bit of water into the food which causes the food to give off an aroma, which draws her to it.

But, I do enjoy my tea, and gunpowder green has been a favorite of mine.  A big problem, though, is trying to find it.  There is a tea store near by that is very expensive.  If you buy 2 oz or more, it's $4.00 an oz.  Too expensive.  I finally found a couple of health food stores where it ranges in price from about 70 to 85 cents an oz, but it is such a hassle to drive there; and too many times they're out.  I've found it on-line, but the shipping costs haven't made it such a good deal.<br /><br />Well, with the ""subscription"" purchase, this is a great deal.  It's cheaper than anywhere I've found it, at $10.20 a pound or less than 64 cents an oz.  And I love that 48 hrs after placing the order, the post office delivered it to my house.<br /><br />So, the big test, then, is how is the tea?

The first, Apollo, is quite enthusiastic about food related assignments and is usually most concerned about quantity.  The second, LJ, is more discerning about food, occasionally refusing to participate.<br /><br />When I opened the first selection, Chicken Pot Pie I noticed a quantity of liquid around the solid portion of the meal and was concerned that it was perhaps spoiled.  I detected no bad odor so I offered it to my panel, who were incidentally becoming quite impatient.  Apollo immediately began to consume his portion, pausing only when the dish was empty.  LJ took her usual cautious sniff of the food and then began to eagerly lap up the liquid, pausing to take a bite of the solids from time to time.  She too did not stop eating until the entire portion was consumed.<br /><br />At the next testing session I offered the Chinese Chicken selection.  This one looked much more like other canned cat food but had a more pronounced odor.  Both testers arrived at their stations without being summoned.  Again both testers were enthusiastic about their assignments and did not stop until the entire portion was consumed.  In fact when the testers were disturbed by two members of the canine food testing team they expressed great displeasure.<br /><br />As I was preparing the food samples a member of the human food testing panel remarked that the feline samples, particularly the Chinese Chicken, looked better than much of the food she had been eating at college.<br /><br />Obviously the feline panel was quite taken with the product.  Our chief accountant had some issues with it however since this product costs about four times as much per ounce as our usual offering. (Note:  usual offering has kept six cats quite healthy for more than thirty years).  With this price factor in mind I divided each single serving (3 oz) can between the two testers and supplemented with dry food.<br /><br />Due to the enthusiastic endorsements by the feline food testers and based on my prior experience with aging felines' diminished appetites, I will purchase this product in the future as a supplement to the usual feline menu offerings, much as the human menu is supplemented by holiday meals or upscale restaurant outings.",caution may cause kitty stampede,called upon panel two expert feline food testers assist review first apollo quite enthusiastic food related assignments usually concerned quantity second lj discerning food occasionally refusing participatewhen opened first selection chicken pot pie noticed quantity liquid around solid portion meal concerned perhaps spoiled detected bad odor offered panel incidentally becoming quite impatient apollo immediately began consume portion pausing dish empty lj took usual cautious sniff food began eagerly lap liquid pausing take bite solids time time stop eating entire portion consumedat next testing session offered chinese chicken selection one looked much like canned cat food pronounced odor testers arrived stations without summoned testers enthusiastic assignments stop entire portion consumed fact testers disturbed two members canine food testing team expressed great displeasureas preparing food samples member human food testing panel remarked feline samples particularly chinese chicken looked better much food eating collegeobviously feline panel quite taken product chief accountant issues however since product costs four times much per ounce usual offering note usual offering kept six cats quite healthy thirty years price factor mind divided single serving 3 oz two testers supplemented dry fooddue enthusiastic endorsements feline food testers based prior experience aging felines diminished appetites purchase product future supplement usual feline menu offerings much human menu supplemented holiday meals upscale restaurant outings,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I tried 2 flavors and the overwhelming characteristic is sweetness. Some may like this, but I do not. The main drawback, though, is the flavoring is not very complex. What I mean is that there is a narrow range of flavor receptors working on your tongue when you drink it. Cast in this mixture of sweetness is a single flavor, it seems. It is not complex; you clearly taste just 2 things: sweetness and a specific flavor.<br /><br />If you enjoy drinking something that is refreshing and/or interesting, this isn't it. For example, if you add a freshly squeezed lemon and some sugar to your water, your whole mouth seems to pick up a range of flavors and sensations that leaves a slight, but satisfying aftertaste. The MiO, on the other hand, hits your tongue with a strong blast of sweetness and flavor, disappears, then leaves an aftertaste lingering on the back of your tongue of that vague, yet strangely familiar taste all artificial sweeteners seem to have.<br /><br />There are better ways to flavor water, I'm afraid, than this.",strongly sweet one dimensional,first impression product another way sell artificial sweetener tried 2 flavors overwhelming characteristic sweetness may like main drawback though flavoring complex mean narrow range flavor receptors working tongue drink cast mixture sweetness single flavor seems complex clearly taste 2 things sweetness specific flavorif enjoy drinking something refreshing andor interesting nt example add freshly squeezed lemon sugar water whole mouth seems pick range flavors sensations leaves slight satisfying aftertaste mio hand hits tongue strong blast sweetness flavor disappears leaves aftertaste lingering back tongue vague yet strangely familiar taste artificial sweeteners seem havethere better ways flavor water m afraid,0.009708737864077669,0.25,0.018691588785046728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009708737864077669,0.25,0.018691588785046728

I also feel the packaging is hugely misleading.  It says, and I quote; ""Sweetened with honey"" with no mention of the sucralose.  It does mention ""no aspartame"" but fails to mention it's other source of sweetness.  The ingredients are as follows: Honey granules (sugar, honey), Citric acid, green tea powder, sucralose, malodextrin, hibiscus extract, natural flavor, and Beta carotene for color.

Due to the simple yet nutritional ingredients of Grandma Lucy's she is doing excellent. It's been several days and NO MORE SCRATCHING...I am so excited that I had to write a review. My dog was so allergic to the many different other foods that we have tried with her that we almost lost all hope and we were going to just highly medicate her for the rest of her life. I didn't want to do that and after looking at the excellent ingredients contained in this brand of food I was hoping for the best. I couldn't be more happy and delighted! She's been on various raw, dry, wet, home cooked, and everything else with no luck. Please Grandma Lucy's never change your ingredients on the Rabbit Pureformance line of food because you have just made our lives a whole lot more stress free, thank you! Anyone with a dog that has bad allergies should really give this food a try...it might be the best decision you've ever made for your dog. I'd also like to add that the preparation for making her food is very simple. Just add warm water to the freeze dried food until you get the desired consistency that you prefer. Let it stand for a few minutes and then it is ready to serve. The food honestly smells amazing and at times I have thought about trying it myself. It's made with all human grade ingredients which is good to know. My dog Sadie is 75lbs and a 10lb bag of this fantastic product lasts us approximately 20 days.

To me it mostly tastes like a mild lemony tea. It tastes pretty good with a few tablespoons of powdered milk (so it doesn't dilute the taste like milk would) and a packet of stevia. What I've noticed with this tea is how it makes the world shimmer. It is as if you are more aware of beauty when you have had a cup of this tea. I've read negative and positive things about yerba mate. So I think it is best to drink this tea occasionally and not to drink it instead of your normal tea or coffee. It is good if you want to focus on reading a good book but this tea can also make you a bit jittery from the caffeine. I also noticed that this was a good appetite suppressant. When I drank this a few hours before dinner I ate way less than normal. I was only eating a salad but made it much smaller than a dinner salad and even skipped adding the chicken. This tea also contains theobromine which is found in chocolate. Since some articles online state that yerba mate causes cancer and others say it cures cancer it is probably best to do your own research before deciding if you want to drink this tea.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",improves mental clarity,tazo s focus tea blend black tea lemon balm chicory cocoa peels roasted yerba mate rose petals citrus essence oil rosemary natural flavors mostly tastes like mild lemony tea tastes pretty good tablespoons powdered milk nt dilute taste like milk would packet stevia ve noticed tea makes world shimmer aware beauty cup tea ve read negative positive things yerba mate think best drink tea occasionally drink instead normal tea coffee good want focus reading good book tea also make bit jittery caffeine also noticed good appetite suppressant drank hours dinner ate way less normal eating salad made much smaller dinner salad even skipped adding chicken tea also contains theobromine found chocolate since articles online state yerba mate causes cancer others say cures cancer probably best research deciding want drink teathe rebecca review,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I get these at my local Jimbo's for $3.85each but am hoping they will be available from Amazon soon!  What a delicious way to g35 14grams of fiber!<br /><br />Instead of sugar, Chocoperfection uses erythritol which has 95% fewer calories than sugar, 93% fewer than maltitol, and no effect on insulin levels, and oligofructose, a sweet tasting dietary fiber made primarily from chicory (not the same as fructose).<br /><br />These silky-smooth, delicious chocolate bars actually help you lose weight because the high fiber content and the high fiber content also acts as an appetite suppressant.<br /><br />And unlike maltitol-sweetened chocolate, ChocoPerfection bars will never upset your stomach, give you gas, make you bloat, or stall your weight loss.  Chocolate Perfect!<br /><br />On top of all that, Chocoperfection is diabetic-safe and tooth-freindly, too.  What more could you ask of a chocolate bar?<br /><br />What is erythritol?<br /><br />Like xylitol, erythritol is a polyol or sometimes called a sugar-alcohol (although none of them contain sugar or alcohol,) and has some of the cavity-fighting similarities.<br /><br />Xylitol is as sweet as sugar and has about 2/3 the calories.<br /><br />Erythritol, on the other hand, is about 70% as sweet as sugar and and almost zero calories.  Plus it is better tolerated by most people<br /><br />with less gastronomical or laxative reactions.  By the way, XylitolNow sells erythritol in bulk on the main product page.<br /><br />Being only 70% as sweet as sugar, erythritol sometimes needs a little help in the sweetness department. In the case of these bars, that's where oligofrutose comes in.<br /><br />What is oligofructose?<br /><br />Oligofructose<br />From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br /><br />Oligofructose, sometimes called Fructooligosaccharide or just  (FOS), is a subgroup of inulin, specifically those fructose polymers with a degree of polymerization (DP) &lt;= 10. Unlike most carbohydrates, it is not digested in the human small intestine and thus has a lower calorific value, whilst contributing to dietary fiber. Oligofructose is on the more soluble side, due to its lower chain length, than the general class of inulins and is therefore commonly used as an additive to yoghurt and other dairy products. It is used specially in combination with high-intensity artificial sweeteners, whose sweetness profile and aftertaste it improves. Oligofructose is also a prebiotic stimulating the growth of bifidobacteria in particular.<br /><br />Food Sources<br />FOS is extracted from fruits and vegetables like bananas, onions, chicory root, garlic, asparagus, barley, wheat, and tomatoes. The Jerusalem Artichoke has been found to have one of the highest concentrations of FOS. (In the case of Chocoperfection, the oligofructose is extracted from chicory root.)<br /><br />Health Benefits<br />FOS has been a popular dietary supplement in Japan for many years and is now becoming increasingly popular in Western cultures for its prebiotic effects. FOS serves as ""fast food"" for the probiotic beneficial or ""friendly"" bacteria that naturally populate the gut, increasing their ability to benefit overall Gastrointestinal Tract (GI Tract) health, especially proper digestion. It has also been touted as a supplement for preventing yeast infections.<br /><br />And this from Steggall Nutrition:<br /><br />Oligofructose is a tremendous substrate for bifidus bacteria, stimulating its activity by several hundred percent. This is called prebiotic activity, referring to stimulation of health promoting bacteria in the intestinal tract. Short chain fatty acids are produced, lowering pH levels and providing an energy source for the growth and maintenance of large intestine cells. This process leads to differentiation of cancer cells, a vital step that is required before cancer cells can be killed.<br /><br />The ideal environment for healthy bacteria is quite different to the environment preferred by pathogens and gram negative putrefactive bacteria. Consequently the undesirable bacteria diminish in number as the healthy bacteria proliferate in the presence of oligofructose.",delicious chocolate way get 14grams fiber 2 net carbs per bar,chocoperfection bars taste good ll never believe good get local jimbo s 385each hoping available amazon soon delicious way g35 14grams fiber instead sugar chocoperfection uses erythritol 95 fewer calories sugar 93 fewer maltitol effect insulin levels oligofructose sweet tasting dietary fiber made primarily chicory fructose these silkysmooth delicious chocolate bars actually help lose weight high fiber content high fiber content also acts appetite suppressantand unlike maltitolsweetened chocolate chocoperfection bars never upset stomach give gas make bloat stall weight loss chocolate perfect top chocoperfection diabeticsafe toothfreindly could ask chocolate bar erythritol like xylitol erythritol polyol sometimes called sugaralcohol although none contain sugar alcohol cavityfighting similaritiesxylitol sweet sugar 23 calorieserythritol hand 70 sweet sugar almost zero calories plus better tolerated peoplewith less gastronomical laxative reactions way xylitolnow sells erythritol bulk main product pagebeing 70 sweet sugar erythritol sometimes needs little help sweetness department case bars s oligofrutose comes inwhat oligofructose oligofructosefrom wikipedia free encyclopediaoligofructose sometimes called fructooligosaccharide fos subgroup inulin specifically fructose polymers degree polymerization dp 10 unlike carbohydrates digested human small intestine thus lower calorific value whilst contributing dietary fiber oligofructose soluble side due lower chain length general class inulins therefore commonly used additive yoghurt dairy products used specially combination highintensity artificial sweeteners whose sweetness profile aftertaste improves oligofructose also prebiotic stimulating growth bifidobacteria particularfood sourcesfos extracted fruits vegetables like bananas onions chicory root garlic asparagus barley wheat tomatoes jerusalem artichoke found one highest concentrations fos case chocoperfection oligofructose extracted chicory root health benefitsfos popular dietary supplement japan many years becoming increasingly popular western cultures prebiotic effects fos serves fast food probiotic beneficial friendly bacteria naturally populate gut increasing ability benefit overall gastrointestinal tract gi tract health especially proper digestion also touted supplement preventing yeast infectionsand steggall nutrition oligofructose tremendous substrate bifidus bacteria stimulating activity several hundred percent called prebiotic activity referring stimulation health promoting bacteria intestinal tract short chain fatty acids produced lowering ph levels providing energy source growth maintenance large intestine cells process leads differentiation cancer cells vital step required cancer cells killedthe ideal environment healthy bacteria quite different environment preferred pathogens gram negative putrefactive bacteria consequently undesirable bacteria diminish number healthy bacteria proliferate presence oligofructose,,,,,,,,,

When I took a fitness course in college I tried a whole bunch of different kinds... which all tasted like chalk to me. I would hold my breath and try not to gag or throw up. So because of that awful experience, I vowed to never again drink nutritional shakes.  Then Amazon came along and offered a free sample to review. I still was reluctant but decided to face my fear. Plus, I really need to get back into shape again :) The fact that it was called a ""shake"" and not a ""protein drink"" made me more hopeful. So, when I finally took my first swig of it today I was pleasantly surprised. Yeah, it actually tastes good... not to be confused with ""bearable"". It actually tastes like a nice strawberry smoothy.<br /><br />Now, I don't know exactly how good it is for you... since it tastes so good. So I can't comment on it's actual ""nutritional value"".  Oh, by the way, I drank the strawberry flavored one. So I don't know how good the other flavors are yet.

I've tried the stovetop method in the past using olive oil, but it's always burned my pot. What I do now is put a great heaping tablespoon of VCO into my 10-quart Fagor canning pot, melt it at 390 on my induction burner, dump in popcorn kernels to just cover the bottom in a single layer, and put on a glass lid I have that fits the pot. Then I just follow through with the popping process, jiggling the pot a little to keep the unpopped kernels falling to the bottom as the kernels pop. I listen for the popping to slow, just like you do with microwave popcorn, and then just turn off the induction burner and let the pot sit a minute while the last few kernels pop. This makes a wonderfully VCO-coated popcorn that can be enjoyed without salt if necessary, or add just a little fine popcorn salt and toss.",keep coming back nutiva,ve tried brands vco keep coming back nutiva s well blended smooth flavor best ve tried love use kinds cooking s especially good cooking bitter greens like turnips collards coconut taste helps cut bitterness giving marvelous flavor greensi ve discovered fantastic way make healthy popcorn using vco ve tried stovetop method past using olive oil s always burned pot put great heaping tablespoon vco 10quart fagor canning pot melt 390 induction burner dump popcorn kernels cover bottom single layer put glass lid fits pot follow popping process jiggling pot little keep unpopped kernels falling bottom kernels pop listen popping slow like microwave popcorn turn induction burner let pot sit minute last kernels pop makes wonderfully vcocoated popcorn enjoyed without salt necessary add little fine popcorn salt toss,0.030534351145038167,1.0,0.059259259259259255,0.023076923076923078,1.0,0.04511278195488722,0.030534351145038167,1.0,0.059259259259259255

The guide showed us the bales of tea as they arrived, machines that ground and mixed the tea, and a machine that put the tea in tea bags.  The tour included a visit to the room where the peppermint tea was stored.  Our guide told us that peppermint was stored separately so that it would not contaminate the other teas.  He did not tell us what was to come.<br /><br />The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us.  We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room.  The smell of peppermint was overpowering.  It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint.  What a rush!  The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry.

As odd as it may sound, I have worked at it over the years to get it ""right."" I'm satisfied with my process and usually use Orville's, but recently found that I love the popcorn at Sundance Theaters. Sometimes I stop in their lobby just to pick up a bag of popcorn to take home for supper. I learned the trick of adding a touch of coconut oil to the popping oil and now I'm on a hunt for the best popping corn. I bought this even though to me the product and shipping cost was steep. I thought that if we bonded---me and the popping corn---it would be worth it. Well, it arrived poorly packed but intact. No matter, I made a batch of popcorn that night and settled in to watch ""Leverage."" The popcorn was tasteless. Made the same way as always, it was completely tasteless. I actually threw it out, which is so unlike me. I threw out the batch and I threw out the entire bag of popping corn. I've been an Amazon.com user since its inception and I think this is only my second poor review. If the popcorn and shipping cost wasn't so pricey it would be a small matter. I just don't want someone else to overextend themselves like I did in a purchase and have such a bad experience. I may be some kind of popcorn elitist, so let me just say that if you have gourmet tastes when it comes to popcorn and a slender pocketbook, don't take a chance on this brand unless you can try a smaller amount, closer to home.",pricey disappointing,love popcorn nt often want great popcorn odd may sound worked years get right m satisfied process usually use orville s recently found love popcorn sundance theaters sometimes stop lobby pick bag popcorn take home supper learned trick adding touch coconut oil popping oil m hunt best popping corn bought even though product shipping cost steep thought bonded me popping corn it would worth well arrived poorly packed intact matter made batch popcorn night settled watch leverage popcorn tasteless made way always completely tasteless actually threw unlike threw batch threw entire bag popping corn ve amazoncom user since inception think second poor review popcorn shipping cost nt pricey would small matter nt want someone else overextend like purchase bad experience may kind popcorn elitist let say gourmet tastes comes popcorn slender pocketbook nt take chance brand unless try smaller amount closer home,0.0064516129032258064,0.5,0.012738853503184712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0064516129032258064,0.5,0.012738853503184712
